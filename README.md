This project features an AI-powered system designed to detect counterfeit currency using advanced deep learning techniques. The system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN), ResNet, and MobileNet models to accurately classify currency images.

Key Features:

Image Upload & Matching: Users can upload images of currency, which are then matched against a trained dataset for verification.

Deep Learning Models: Implements CNN, ResNet, and MobileNet architectures for robust classification.

Image Preprocessing: Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow for efficient image preprocessing, enhancing model accuracy.

Model Training: Trained on over 2,000 images, achieving approximately 85% classification accuracy.

Performance Optimization: Reduced false positives by 15% through advanced preprocessing techniques.

Technologies:
Python
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Keras (for model implementation)

Goals:
Develop a reliable and user-friendly tool to assist in identifying counterfeit currency, reducing the risk of false positives, and improving overall detection accuracy.
